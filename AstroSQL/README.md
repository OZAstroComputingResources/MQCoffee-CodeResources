# SQL (Structured Query Language) for astronomy and astrophysics - 12 Sep 2013 - Colin Navin

To run the examples etc download and install [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/). You can install and run it anywhere, but wherever you put it copy the files below ([test.db](test.db) and [SQLtest.py](SQLtest.py)) into the same folder. For the python code all you need is python 2.7.

Some background on relational databases and SQL: [sql_for_astro.pdf](sql_for_astro.pdf)

Some sample SQL queries etc that you can cut and paste and try out:
[sql_file_reference.md](sql_file_reference.md)

The test database used in the presentation: [test.db](test.db)

The python code with embedded SQL statements: [SQLtest.py](SQLtest.py)
