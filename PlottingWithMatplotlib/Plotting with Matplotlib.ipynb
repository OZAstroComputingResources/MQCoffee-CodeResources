    "## What is a figure?\n",
    "Figures in matplotlib correspond to a single output image e.g. a single PNG, EPS or SVG file. Figures can have multiple plots, and a script can create multiple figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figures in matplotlib are instances of a class [`matplotlib.figure.Figure`](https://matplotlib.org/api/figure_api.html#matplotlib.figure.Figure), and have all the methods and attributes defined there.\n",
    "\n",
    "**However**, you can't just call `matplotlib.figure.Figure` and everything works, the figure need to talk to the backend (this is where Matplotlib's state machine comes in -- the thing which drives Matplotlib).\n",
    "Instead, we use [`matplotlib.pyplot`](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_summary.html), which we usually import as `plt`, i.e.:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "```\n",
    "(FYI, `matplotlib` is usually imported as `mpl`)\n",
    "\n",
    "`matplotlib.pyplot` (which we'll call `plt` from now on) handles all the backend stuff, and so if you're doing stuff with backends, you need to do that before importing `plt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create figures via `plt` in a number of ways, but the two main ways are [`plt.figure()`](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.figure) and [`plt.subplots()`](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.subplots).\n",
    "\n",
    "`plt.figure()` returns just a figure, and takes almost same arguments as `matplotlib.figure.Figure` (there's a few extra arguments that `plt.figure()` takes, but don't worry about them).\n",
    "\n",
    "`plt.subplots()` returns both a figure, and all the axes for the figure. `plt.subplots()` is newer than `plt.figure()`, and does most of what you want from managing axes which you have to do manually for `plt.figure()`. `plt.subplots()` takes similar arguments to `plt.figure()`, plus it can use [`matplotlib.gridspec`](https://matplotlib.org/users/gridspec.html) to do more complex layouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, you want to use `plt.subplots()` over `plt.figure()`."

    "## What is an axes?\n",
    "Axes in matplotlib are the plots: the easiest way to get one is to use `plt.subplots()` as above. [`matplotlib.axes.Axes`](https://matplotlib.org/api/axes_api.html#matplotlib.axes.Axes) is the underlying class.\n",
    "\n",
    "As outlined in https://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html#matplotlib-pyplot-and-pylab-how-are-they-related, https://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html#what-is-interactive-mode, and https://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html#coding-styles, there are different levels of the API, the Matlab-like `pylab` interface, the more python-like `plt` interface, and the \"Object Oriented\" (OO) interface, which is the most explicit and which avoids the most hidden aspects (I'm skipping over how the figures and backends are linked up, as unless you plan on writing a new backend or use matplotlib as part of a GUI you don't need to worry about it).\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to use the OO interface. This means we only use `plt` to create the figure (and show and close the figure).\n",
    "\n",
    "Something worth noting is that for some reason `Figure.show()` doesn't work how you expect, so `plt.show()` is almost always what you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, if you create a bunch of figures, they do take up memory. It's best to close figures via `plt.close()` when you're done with them."
