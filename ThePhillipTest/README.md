# The "Philip Test" - 11 Apr 2014 - James Tocknell

The Philip Test is a "quiz" to see how effectively you are producing research with respect to programming. It can be found here: http://pgbovine.net/research-programming-workflow.htm.

http://blog.rtwilson.com/how-effective-is-my-research-programming-workflow-the-philip-test-part-1/, http://blog.rtwilson.com/how-effective-is-my-research-programming-workflow-the-philip-test-part-2/ and http://blog.rtwilson.com/how-effective-is-my-research-programming-workflow-the-philip-test-part-3/ are how another scientist (geologist) preforms on this test.

An example Makefile (the one from my Honours) is [here](Makefile).

Other papers we looked at include http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013A%26C.....1...54S, http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7064, http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0530, and some presentations at http://astrocompute.wordpress.com/2014/01/24/astrophysics-code-sharing-ii-the-sequel-at-aas-223/.
