# Coffee and Code Resources from Macquarie University

Coffee and Code is a fortnightly meetup of (mainly) astronomers from the Physics and Astronomy Department at Macquarie University. The focus of Coffee and Code is to improve the computational skills of MRes and PhD students, as well as any PostDocs and Faculty who also wish to come along.
