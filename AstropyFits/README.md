# astropy.io.fits - 9 Oct 2014 - Colin Navin

Here is the jupyter notebook used as a demo: [astropy.io.fits_demo.ipynb](astropy.io.fits_demo.ipynb)

To open the jupyter notebook, save it somewhere on your computer. Open a terminal window, navigate to that directory and type 'jupyter notebook'. Then, select the astropy.io.fits demo.ipynb file under the browser tab.

Here is a .fits file that you can use to practice on [test.fits](test.fits) but you can use any .fits file. Save it in the same directory as the jupyter notebook.

You'll need jupyter, numpy, astropy and matplotlib
